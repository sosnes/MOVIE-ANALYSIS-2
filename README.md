### Project Overview
This analysis is for Microsoft and they want me to use this analysis to generate insights for the business stakeholder

### Business Problem
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.This analysis will answer the following questions:

- Which is the most watched movie genre ?
- Which movie genres have the most votes?
- Which movie genres are doing the best at the boxoffice putting in consideration the Domestic gross and WorldWide gross

### Data Understanding
1.**Source of Data**

For the analysis I will be using movie datasets from:
- [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com)
- [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
- [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
- [The numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)
- [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)



. 

2.**Description of data**
    
- **Box Office Mojo** is a popular website that tracks box office revenue for movies.

- **IMDb**, or the Internet Movie Database, is an online database of information related to films, television programs, home  videos, video games, and streaming content.
   
- **Rotten Tomatoes** is a website that aggregates reviews and provides a numerical score based on the percentage of critics who have given a favorable review for movies, TV shows, and sometimes other forms of media

- **The Movie Database (TMDb)** is an online database that provides information about movies, TV shows, and celebrities.
   
- **The Numbers** is a website that focuses on providing detailed financial information and box office data for movies. It offers comprehensive information on box office earnings, budgets, production costs, and revenue generated by films worldwide.

Some are compressed CSV (comma-separated values) or TSV (tab-separated values) files that can be opened using spreadsheet software
or pd.read_csv, while the data from IMDB is located in a SQLite database.This is the ERD for the
IMBD data as shown below
